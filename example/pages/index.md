Hello!

I'm Vilberg, a Developer based in Sweden. After over 5 years of experience in Web Development, I've recently started my journey to learn more about Rust and systems programming! I will be sharing what I learn on the way on this website.

If you're curious to learn more, take a look at my first post about how I intend to learn Rust!
